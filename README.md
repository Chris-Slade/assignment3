# Assignment 3
Repo for assignment 3, Object Oriented PHP.

# Instructions

### assignment3.php

This will be the main "view" file where all the output will go. This is also
where the HTML code will go. All of the data produced from the class and
subclass will show on this page.

### class.php

Similar to what we went over in class, we want to create a PHP class, with
objects and methods that we can extend to another class.

Include the following:

- Function(s) that will take any type of parameters you want (string, number,
array, etc.), work with those parameters and deliver some sort of output.
- Make sure to use at least 2 PHP magic methods (one you pretty much have to
have).
- For example you could have the class accept text values and put them together
for display (similar to what we did in class. You should try to come up with
something original though.)

### subclass.php

Here we want to extend the class we created in the above file.

You can have any number of methods that will in some way use the parent class
but also implement its own separate functionality.

Include the following:

- At least 2 PHP magic methods.
- Clone the original object for later use.

### Requirements 

* Fork and clone this repo locally.
* Create a new branch to work on (not master).
* When you are done working, submit a pull request to the original repo.

When I run the code, I'm expecting the following:

- Some sort of styled output (doesn't need to be a work of art, but do
something to make it look nice).
- Use of variables when appropriate.
- Use of arrays when appropriate.
- You don't need to do anything with JS, unless you want to.
- No PHP errors on the page (zero points if the code does not run).
- Display the data you created in the models.
- Change that data and show any progression of change (like how we did in the
class example).
- You are free to create whatever data you want.

You can also refer to the OOP PHP example files that can be found on the class
site.

(The file tree is the way it is for ease of including assets.)
